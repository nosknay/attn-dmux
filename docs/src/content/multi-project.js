    <h1>Multi-Project</h1>
    <p class="lead">dmux supports attaching multiple git repositories to a single tmux session, letting you manage panes, file browsers, and visibility controls across different projects side by side.</p>

    <h2>Attaching a Project</h2>
    <p>Press <kbd>p</kbd> in the dmux TUI to create a pane in a different project. dmux will prompt you to select a project directory. The new project is attached to the current session and appears as a separate group in the sidebar.</p>

    <div class="callout callout-info">
      <div class="callout-title">How it works</div>
      Each attached project gets its own <code>.dmux/</code> directory and worktree space. The tmux session is shared, but pane tracking is per-project.
    </div>

    <h2>Project Navigation</h2>
    <p>When multiple projects are attached:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Use <kbd>←</kbd> <kbd>→</kbd> to switch between project groups in the sidebar</li>
      <li>Use <kbd>↑</kbd> <kbd>↓</kbd> to navigate panes within a project</li>
      <li>Use <kbd>P</kbd> to temporarily show only the active project's panes, then press it again to restore all panes</li>
      <li>Each project's panes are visually grouped and labeled</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Pane Grouping</h2>
    <p>The sidebar organizes panes by project. Each group shows:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The project name (derived from the directory)</li>
      <li>The number of active panes</li>
      <li>Individual pane status indicators</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Sub-Worktree Discovery</h2>
    <p>dmux automatically discovers when a worktree is nested inside another project's directory. This is useful for monorepo setups where you might have:</p>
    <div class="file-tree">monorepo/
├── .dmux/worktrees/
│   └── feat-api/           # Worktree for the monorepo
│       └── packages/
│           └── api/
└── packages/
    └── api/
        └── .dmux/worktrees/
            └── fix-endpoint/  # Worktree for the api package</div>

    <p>dmux tracks these relationships so it can merge in the correct order.</p>

    <h2>Per-Project File Browser</h2>
    <p>Press <kbd>f</kbd> on any worktree pane to open a read-only file browser rooted at that pane's worktree. In a shared session, the browser stays attached to the same project group as the pane it came from.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Use this to inspect frontend and backend repos independently without leaving the shared session</li>
      <li>Browser panes respect project visibility controls such as <kbd>P</kbd> and hidden-pane toggles</li>
      <li>If a browser for that worktree is already open, dmux focuses it instead of opening a duplicate</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Multi-Merge Orchestration</h2>
    <p>When merging across multiple projects with nested worktrees, dmux merges <strong>deepest first</strong>. This ensures that:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Child project changes are merged before parent project changes</li>
      <li>The parent worktree sees the child's merged state when it merges</li>
      <li>No conflicts arise from stale sub-project references</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Creating Panes in Other Projects</h2>
    <p>There are two ways to create panes in attached projects:</p>
    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr><th>Method</th><th>Description</th></tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr><td><kbd>p</kbd></td><td>Interactive project selection then prompt input</td></tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <h2>Session Layout</h2>
    <p>All projects share the same tmux session. When using sidebar layout mode (<kbd>L</kbd>), panes from all projects are arranged in the grid. The sidebar clearly labels which project each pane belongs to, and you can hide or restore panes without interrupting the work running inside them.</p>

    <div class="callout callout-tip">
      <div class="callout-title">Tip</div>
      Multi-project is especially useful for full-stack development — attach your frontend and backend repos to the same session and run agents on both simultaneously.
    </div>
