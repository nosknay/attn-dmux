# AGENTS.md - dmux Maintainer Guide

This file is the maintainer-focused source of truth for working on dmux itself.

## Docs map

- `README.md`: end-user overview and install/usage.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`: local development loop and PR workflow.
- `AGENTS.md` (this file): maintainer behavior, architecture landmarks, and current dev-mode workflow.

`CLAUDE.md` is a symlink to this file for tool compatibility.

## Project overview

dmux is a TypeScript + Ink TUI for managing parallel AI-agent work in tmux panes backed by git worktrees.

Core behavior:

- One project-scoped dmux session (stable name based on project root hash)
- One worktree per work pane
- Agent launch + prompt bootstrap in each pane
- Merge/close actions with worktree cleanup hooks
- Optional multi-project grouping in one session

## Important architecture landmarks

- `src/index.ts`: startup, tmux session attach/create, control pane management, dev-mode startup behavior
- `src/DmuxApp.tsx`: main TUI state, status/footer, input hookups, source switching
- `src/hooks/useInputHandling.ts`: keyboard and menu action handling
- `src/services/PopupManager.ts`: popup launch + data plumbing
- `src/actions/types.ts`: action registry and menu visibility rules
- `src/actions/implementations/closeAction.ts`: close behavior + source fallback on source-pane removal
- `src/components/panes/*`: pane list rendering (includes source indicator)

## Adding a new agent to the registry

The agent registry is centralized in `src/utils/agentLaunch.ts`.

1. Add the new ID to `AGENT_IDS` (this updates the `AgentName` type).
2. Add a full entry in `AGENT_REGISTRY` for that ID with:
   - metadata (`name`, `shortLabel`, `description`, `slugSuffix`)
   - install detection (`installTestCommand`, `commonPaths`)
   - launch behavior (`promptCommand`, `promptTransport`, plus `promptOption` or `sendKeys*` fields when needed)
   - permission mapping (`permissionFlags`) and `defaultEnabled`
   - optional resume behavior (`resumeCommandTemplate`) and startup command split (`noPromptCommand`)
3. Keep `shortLabel` unique and exactly 2 characters (enforced at runtime).

Most UI/settings surfaces consume `getAgentDefinitions()`, so they pick up registry additions automatically (for example, enabled-agents settings and chooser popups).

Related places to verify after adding an agent:

- `src/utils/agentDetection.ts` for install detection behavior
- `__tests__/agentLaunch.test.ts` for registry/permission/command expectations
- `docs/src/content/agents.js` (static docs page; update supported-agent docs when behavior changes)

Recommended validation:

```bash
pnpm run typecheck
pnpm run test
```

## Maintainer local workflow (dmux-on-dmux)

`pnpm dev` is the standard entry point when editing dmux.

What it does:

1. Bootstraps local docs/hooks (`dev:bootstrap`)
2. Compiles TypeScript once
3. Launches dmux in dev mode from `dist/index.js` (built runtime parity)
4. Auto-promotes to watch mode when launched in tmux

Result: changes in this worktree should recompile/restart automatically without repeated manual relaunches.

## Dev-mode source workflow

In DEV mode, a single source path is active at a time.

- Use pane menu action: `[DEV] Use as Source`
- Hotkey equivalent: `S`

Toggle semantics:

- Toggling on a non-source worktree pane switches source to that worktree.
- Toggling on the currently active source pane switches source back to project root.
- If the active source pane/worktree is closed or removed, source automatically falls back to project root.

UI cues:

- Footer shows `DEV MODE source: <branch>`
- Active source pane is marked with `[source]` in the pane list
- Dev-only actions are prefixed with `[DEV]` and only shown in DEV mode

## Dev diagnostics

Use:

```bash
pnpm run dev:doctor
```

Checks include:

- session exists
- control pane validity
- watch command detection
- active source path
- generated docs file presence
- local hooks presence

## Hooks and generated docs

`pnpm dev` and `pnpm dev:watch` both ensure generated hooks docs exist before runtime.

Key artifacts:

- `src/utils/generated-agents-doc.ts`
- local hooks under `.dmux-hooks/` (notably `worktree_created`, `pre_merge`)

## Pull request workflow

Recommended:

1. Run dmux from a maintainer worktree with `pnpm dev`.
2. Create worktree panes for features/fixes.
3. Iterate and merge via dmux.
4. Run checks before PR:

```bash
pnpm run typecheck
pnpm run test
```

## Notes for maintainers

- Keep `pnpm dev` as the default path for dmux development.
- Treat `dev:watch` as internal machinery behind the default `dev` entrypoint.
- Keep dev-only controls hidden outside DEV mode.
- Update this file when dev workflow behavior changes.

## Attentive-specific usage notes

This fork is maintained for use with Attentive's development workflow. Key conventions:

**Settings:** Do not commit `.dmux/settings.json` to individual repos. Instead, configure
shared defaults once in `~/.dmux.global.json` on your machine:

```json
{
  "defaultAgent": "claude",
  "enabledAgents": ["claude"],
  "permissionMode": "bypassPermissions"
}
```

`baseBranch` does not need to be set — dmux detects it automatically via `origin/HEAD`.

**Hooks:** Attentive-specific hook logic lives in `.dmux-hooks/lib/attentive.sh` and is
sourced by the lifecycle hooks. Do not inline Attentive-specific logic directly into hook
files — keep it in the lib file so it stays consolidated and easy to update.

**Slug generation:** `src/utils/slug.ts` has been modified to extract JIRA keys from
prompts (e.g. `"JNY-1234: fix the auth bug"` → branch `jny-1234-fix-auth-bug`) and to
use `attn-` as the fallback prefix instead of `dmux-`.

**WAL (Write-Ahead Log):** dmux runs an HTTP server on startup (default port 3142) that
backs a shared WAL stored at `~/.dmux-workspaces/attn-wal.db` (DuckDB). Agents in
parallel panes use it to signal intent, share discoveries, and avoid conflicts.

The `worktree_created` hook appends WAL usage instructions to each worktree's `CLAUDE.md`
so agents know the helpers are available. The helpers live in `.dmux-hooks/lib/attentive.sh`:

```bash
source "$DMUX_ROOT/.dmux-hooks/lib/attentive.sh"

wal_write "intent"    "about to modify AccountService.java"
wal_write "discovery" "param store key /prod/db-url is unused"
wal_write "blocked"   "waiting on JNY-5678 to merge"
wal_write "done"      "PR opened"

wal_read                        # current session entries
wal_history "jiraKey=JNY-1234"  # cross-session query
```

Query the DB directly at any time:

```bash
duckdb ~/.dmux-workspaces/attn-wal.db \
  "SELECT slug, type, payload, ts FROM wal_entries WHERE jira_key = 'JNY-1234' ORDER BY ts"
```
